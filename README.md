# Jobbsokerportal

Web application built with Next.js and TailwindCSS.</br>
Students can see all the internship applications that are available.</br>
Teachers can login to the admin panel and see/edit/add/remove internship applications.</br>

Note: The admin panel is not secured with bcrypt as of now since this was just a quick project requested by my teacher. (this can easily be implemented for stronger security)

Deployment: https://jobbsokerportal.vercel.app
